Responsive design and mobile menu implementation.

## Overview
This project is the sixth assignment of the GoIT Full Stack Developer course. It focuses on building a fully responsive webpage using CSS media queries and the Mobile First approach. The page adapts to multiple screen sizes and includes a functional mobile menu that works seamlessly across devices.
